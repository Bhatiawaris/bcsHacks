# Habit Builder - BCS Hacks 2024

For BCS Hacks 2024, we developed an OpenAI web application that outlines detailed habit plans to help users reach their desired goals more effectively. Our project was inspired by the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, which lays out all the rules for changing habits in a straightforward way, along with the philosophies that make habit changes more effective. James Clear outlines four philosophies in his book: make the goal obvious, make it attractive (motivational), make it easy, and make it satisfying. With Habit Builder, users can enter a goal they wish to accomplish. Our application takes in the entered goal and returns ten possible habits that can help achieve this goal. Users can select up to four of these habits to create a more detailed plan following the Atomic Habits philosophy (obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying), enabling them to guide their goal progress.

## Learning 

Overall, the project was an excellent opportunity for our team to learn how to build a full-stack web application from scratch. The greatest takeaway from this project was learning how to integrate AI (e.g., OpenAI) into web applications. It was our team's first time using the OpenAI API, and we learned how to format prompt data from our frontend to work best with OpenAI. We initially encountered challenges parsing our JSON prompts so that the output from the OpenAI API could be properly displayed on our frontend. However, we were able to overcome this challenge through manual testing methods and trial and error.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’» 
The frontend was made with React, using Chakra UI as a library. The backend was created with node.js and express as middleware for the OpenAI API. Postman was used for backend testing.
